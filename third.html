                    it happen too even when you're not doing well yourself.  Your very supportive too and your support is like a

                    It's not just the big things; it's the little moments, the genuine happiness you show for our achievements, 
                    that make you stand out. You're like a cheerleader for all of us, you're the best. You're more than deserving

                    you'll make your parents proud In Sha Allah. You're the best, and I hope you'll stay the same no matter what.

                    Always remember, I'm here for you whenever you need to vent (we both have those moments).

                    I reakky appreciate your presence and all that you've done for me.
                    Remember when you mentioned that a listener needs a listener too? 
                    It didn't fully resonate with me at first, but over time, I've come to understand and appreciate 
                    the depth of what you actually meant and just like that there are so many insights you've shared 
                    that have only recently clicked for me, and your guidance has been invaluable.
