                    It's not just the big things; it's the little moments, the genuine happiness you show for our achievements,

                    you'll make your parents proud In Sha Allah. You're the best, and I hope you'll stay the same no matter what.

                    Always remember, I'm here for you whenever you need to vent (we both do lol but still). Anyways you're super

                    It didn't fully resonate with me at first, but over time, I've come to understand and appreciate 
                    the depth of what you actually meant and just like that there are so many insights you've shared 
                    that have only recently clicked for me, and your guidance has been invaluable. (i have no idea what im talking)
